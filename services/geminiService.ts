// This file is intentionally left blank or can be removed if no longer imported.
// All Gemini AI related functionality has been removed from the application.

// Placeholder for HabitWithStreak to avoid breaking imports if any component still expects it,
// though it's best to remove such dependencies.
// import { HabitWithStreak } from "../types";


// The following functions are no longer used and have been removed:
// export const getMotivationalQuote = async (): Promise<string> => { ... };
// export const getHabitAdvice = async (habitName: string, habitCue: string, habitIntention: string): Promise<string> => { ... };
// export const getHabitReviewAdvice = async (habit: HabitWithStreak, completionRateLast30Days: number): Promise<string> => { ... };

export {}; // Ensures this is treated as a module if it's empty.
